Right to Left and Farsi Mapping for Vim		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="farsi">farsi</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Farsi">Farsi</a>*</b>

Farsi support has been removed in patch 8.1.0932.  At that time it was
outdated and unused.

If you would like to bring Farsi support back, please have a look at the old
Farsi code, as it was present at the 8.1 release.  It should be merged with
Arabic support using the Unicode character set.
